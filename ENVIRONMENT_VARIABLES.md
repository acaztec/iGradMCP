# Environment Variables

The scripted demo does not rely on any external services, so no environment variables are required to run locally or on Vercel.

If you extend the experience with APIs or databases, add your configuration to `.env` (see `.env.example` for a blank template) and remember to replicate those variables in your deployment environment.

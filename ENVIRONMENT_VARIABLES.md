# Environment Variables

The final CBCS guidance is generated by OpenAI, so the following variables must be set locally and in production deployments:

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes | API key with access to the target model (defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`). |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | No | Override the OpenAI model name if you prefer a different capability tier. |
| `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | No | Use a custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint (defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1`). |

Add these values to `.env` for local development (see `.env.example`), then replicate them in your Vercel project settings before deploying.

# Complete Vercel Deployment Solution

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### Problem 1: Turbo/pnpm Workspace Misconfiguration
**Error:**
```
x Could not resolve workspaces.
`-> Missing `packageManager` field in package.json
Error: Command "cd ../.. && turbo run build --filter={apps/web}..." exited with 1
```

**Cause:**
- `turbo.json` and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` existed but weren't properly configured
- When Root Directory = `apps/web`, Vercel detected these files in parent directory
- Tried to use Turborepo but configuration was incomplete

**Fix:** Removed unnecessary monorepo tooling files:
- ✅ Deleted `turbo.json`
- ✅ Deleted `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- ✅ Removed `pnpm` from engines in `package.json`

### Problem 2: Localhost Registry in .npmrc
**Error:**
```
registry=http://localhost:9092/npm-registry
```

**Cause:**
- `.npmrc` pointed to localhost registry
- Would fail on Vercel's build servers

**Fix:**
- ✅ Deleted `.npmrc` file

### Problem 3: Output Directory Confusion
**Error:**
```
Error: No Output Directory named "public" found after the Build completed.
```

**Cause:**
- Even with Root Directory set, Vercel didn't recognize this as a Next.js project
- Vercel looked for `public` directory instead of `.next`
- Framework auto-detection failed

**Fix:**
- ✅ Set Root Directory to `apps/web` in Vercel Dashboard
- ✅ Added `vercel.json` in `apps/web/` directory with `"framework": "nextjs"`
- ✅ Added `.npmrc` to `.gitignore` to prevent localhost registry from being committed

## Complete Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Push Latest Code

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix: Remove turbo/pnpm config and .npmrc for Vercel"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Configure Vercel

1. **Go to Project Settings in Vercel**
   - Navigate to your project dashboard
   - Click **Settings**

2. **Set Root Directory**
   - Under **General** settings
   - Find **Root Directory**
   - Click **Edit**
   - Enter: `apps/web`
   - Click **Save**

3. **Verify Build Settings**
   - Framework Preset: Should auto-detect as **Next.js**
   - Build Command: (leave default - will use `next build`)
   - Output Directory: (leave default - will use `.next`)
   - Install Command: (leave default - will use `npm install`)

4. **Set Environment Variables**

   Under **Environment Variables** section, add:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY = your_openai_api_key
   MCP_URL = http://localhost:3001/mcp
   MCP_API_KEY = your_secure_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://nrlwfowagmrefkloncjv.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im5ybHdmb3dhZ21yZWZrbG9uY2p2Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTk1MTg2MzAsImV4cCI6MjA3NTA5NDYzMH0.eO2DEhcyQALSqFgF-y8uUmN6kV2JrBlVBxg65DJmpN8
   ```

### Step 3: Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **...** menu on the latest deployment
3. Click **Redeploy**
4. Or push a new commit to trigger deployment

## Why This Works

### Project Structure
```
Repository Root (/)
├── apps/
│   └── web/                    ← Root Directory points HERE
│       ├── package.json        ← Has "next" dependency
│       ├── next.config.js      ← Next.js config
│       ├── vercel.json         ← Specifies framework: "nextjs"
│       ├── src/                ← Application code
│       └── .next/              ← Build output (created by Next.js)
├── packages/
│   └── mcp-server/
├── package.json                ← Root package (minimal, for tooling only)
├── .gitignore                  ← Ignores .npmrc
└── [NO turbo.json]             ← Removed
└── [NO pnpm-workspace.yaml]    ← Removed
└── [NO .npmrc]                 ← Removed and ignored
```

### Vercel's Behavior with Root Directory = `apps/web`

1. **Treats `apps/web` as project root**
2. **Reads `vercel.json` and sees `"framework": "nextjs"`**
3. **Recognizes this as a Next.js project**
4. **Runs `npm install` in `apps/web`**
5. **Runs `next build` in `apps/web`**
6. **Finds output in `.next/` subdirectory**
7. **Deploys successfully with Next.js runtime**

## Verification Checklist

After deployment succeeds:

- [ ] Build logs show "Detected Next.js 14.x.x"
- [ ] Build logs show "✓ Compiled successfully"
- [ ] Deployment status shows "Ready"
- [ ] Home page loads without 404 error
- [ ] All routes work correctly
- [ ] API routes respond (/api/chat)

## Common Issues

### If you still get errors:

1. **Clear Vercel cache**
   - Redeploy without cache
   - Settings → Redeploy → Uncheck "Use existing build cache"

2. **Verify Root Directory**
   - Must be exactly: `apps/web`
   - Not `./apps/web`
   - Not `/apps/web`
   - Just `apps/web`

3. **Check environment variables**
   - All variables set correctly
   - No trailing spaces
   - Values are valid

4. **Verify latest code is pushed**
   - Check GitHub shows latest commit
   - Vercel is deploying from correct branch (main)

## Local Development

Local development continues to work the same:

```bash
# From repository root
npm run dev        # Runs Next.js dev server
npm run build      # Builds Next.js app
npm run dev:mcp    # Runs MCP server
npm run build:mcp  # Builds MCP server
```

The root `package.json` scripts still work because they explicitly `cd` into subdirectories.

## Summary

**The fixes applied:**
1. ✅ Removed `turbo.json` - wasn't needed, was confusing Vercel
2. ✅ Removed `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - wasn't needed
3. ✅ Removed `.npmrc` - was pointing to localhost
4. ✅ Removed `pnpm` from engines - using npm only
5. ✅ Documented Root Directory requirement

**The deployment process:**
1. Set Root Directory to `apps/web` in Vercel settings
2. Vercel auto-detects Next.js
3. Vercel builds and deploys correctly

**Result:** Clean, working Next.js deployment on Vercel.

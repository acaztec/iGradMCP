# Aztec IET Assistant

This repository hosts a lightweight demo of Aztec's Integrated Education & Training assistant. The experience mirrors the desired scholarship-style interface: learners are greeted by Aztec IET, choose from four pathway buttons, and walk through a guided conversation for the Certified Billing and Coding Specialist (CBCS) track while the other pathways remain placeholders.

## Architecture Overview

- **apps/web** â€“ Next.js 14 application deployed on Vercel. The `/api/chat` route walks learners through scripted intake questions and, once complete, sends the responses to OpenAI for the final CBCS guidance summary.
- **UI components** â€“ Tailwind-powered layout that matches the provided mock (hero card with four pathway buttons, chat transcript, and composer).

## Key Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Guided CBCS flow** â€“ Collects diploma status, soft-skill focus, and returns an AI-authored plan with targeted lessons and next steps.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Mock-aligned UI** â€“ Hero card, purple-accent buttons, and rounded chat surfaces that match the reference screenshot.
- ðŸ¤– **AI-powered wrap-up** â€“ The deterministic intake feeds a structured prompt to OpenAI so the closing message sounds like Aztec's coaching voice.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- An OpenAI API key with access to `gpt-4o` (configurable via `OPENAI_MODEL`).

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env # then add OPENAI_API_KEY
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to interact with the demo. The chat API reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` (and optional `OPENAI_MODEL`/`OPENAI_BASE_URL`) from your environment when generating the final response.

## Deployment

1. Push changes to your repository.
2. Import the project into Vercel (Root Directory: `apps/web`).
3. Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` (and optional `OPENAI_MODEL`/`OPENAI_BASE_URL`) in the Vercel dashboard.
4. Deploy and confirm the final CBCS summary is generated by the AI service.

## Customisation Tips

- Update `PATHWAY_OPTIONS` in `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` to adjust the button copy or enable additional pathways.
- Modify the intake logic in `apps/web/src/app/api/chat/route.ts` to adjust the question flow or expand the OpenAI prompt that powers the final response.

## Testing

From the repository root:

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0
```

Built for quick CBCS demos while the broader IET experience evolves.

# Quick Start

Run the CBCS demo locally in three simple steps.

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open the app**
   Visit http://localhost:3000, pick the **Certified Billing and Coding Specialist (CBCS)** pathway, and follow the prompts.

Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env` (see `.env.example`) before starting the server so the final response can be generated by the AI service.

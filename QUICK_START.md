# Quick Start

Run the Pharmacy Technician demo locally in three simple steps.

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open the app**
   Visit http://localhost:3000, pick the **Pharmacy Technician** pathway, and follow the prompts.

No API keys or databases are requiredâ€”the conversation is scripted for reliable demos.
